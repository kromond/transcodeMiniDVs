This is a script I used to transcode, deinterlace and upscale some mini DV tapes I had using *VapourSynth* and *ffmpeg-python*


This was a project I'd been thinking about for years, ripping some miniDV tapes I had recorded from 2001, when I bought a [Sony DCR-PC110](https://www.videomaker.com/article/c5/8210-sony-digital-camcorder-review-dcr-pc110-mini-dv), until about 2009 when it stopped working.

To do the task, I bought a second hand mini dv camcorder with firewire (not all of these camcorders had firewire digital transfer capablility) and a firewire pci card for my workstation.  Then I ripped them, one at a time 20x.  These transfer in real time, so an hour each.  I totally forgot how long it takes to rewind tapes.  The software for getting the videos transfereed to the computer was not as straight forward as I thought.  I remembered that Premier Pro could do this, but like many others I found on the internet, I couldn't get that to work.  I ended up using [this](http://www.scenalyzer.com/), after finding the author replying to someone with my same issue on a forum.  This software worked fine for the most part.  A couple of my tapes transferred with lots of static, but I don't attribute this to that software.  One issue I somethimes had was it had some trouble detecting NTSC sometimes.  My original camera and tapes were NTSC, my second hand camera is PAL.  Eventually it came right

After all the rips, I had 1300+ clips all in folders from the tape name.  These come in as AVI files with the DVCPRO codec.  I wanted to deinterlace these and have them as h264 files so I set about making a script to do this.

I stared with ffmpeg, but found lots of people on the internet pointing to QTGMC as the preferred choice for deinterlacing.  This sent me down a rabbit hole where I learned all about [AviSynth](http://avisynth.nl/index.php/Main_Page) and the Doom9 and VideoHelp forums.  While reading up on AviSynth and searching things to get it working, I kept seeing references to [VapourSynth](https://www.vapoursynth.com/).  It wasn't until I had something working in AviSynth and began to consider how I could write some python to do this task in batch did I realize what VapourSynth was all about.  It's a re-working of AviSynth for the modern world and uses python.  So I started digging into this.  This was not exactly starting over, but was close.  [This guy](https://macilatthefront.blogspot.com/2018/12/using-vapoursynth-for-qtgmc-round-one.html) has a blog that I used for clues, first for AviSynth, then for VapourSynth.  Collecting all the bits and getting the right versions aligned took a bit of time.  Eventually I got there.

I used a conda environment for collecing all my bits.  The script above is using [ffmpeg-python](https://github.com/kkroening/ffmpeg-python) to get the encoding done right in the script, which I thought would be better then the 'vspipe.exe' which was widely referenced as the method to run VapourSynth scripts using the commandline.  I wanted to stay in python because I could find all my files and I was pretty certain there would be some way to pipe into ffmpeg right in the script.  For some reason,I didn't find any examples of this to reference, I didn't see anyone doing this.  I found [this post](https://forum.videohelp.com/threads/392480-Easy-way-to-encode-vpy-scripts#post2544851) which had the clues that got me there in the end along with some trial and error.  I am glad I went this route, as I'm sure this pipe-to-ffmpeg-python will be something I use again.

This script above includes all the settings I used to encode my movie files.  I'm no expert so there may be better options for better visuals or faster encoding, but this is what I was happy with.  I encoded with NVEnc and was seeing 28fps encoding typically.  My process ran for a few days.  If I were to do it again, I'd put in some logging.  I hope this is helpful for someone
